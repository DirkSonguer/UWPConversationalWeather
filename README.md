# Conversational Weather: Glanceable weather information to prepare you for the day

This is a simple, native weather app for Windows 10 Mobile, made with UWP.
It uses OpenWeatherMap to pull the weather data and the Meteocons icon
set for the icons.

Note that the goal of this app was not to create a polished weather app, but to
learn the basics of Windows 10 development. So assume that the code is probably
not the best source of reference on how to implement things.
